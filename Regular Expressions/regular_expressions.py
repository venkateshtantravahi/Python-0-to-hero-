"""
A regular expression(REgEx) is a sequence f characters that defines a search pattern
MetaCHaracters : [] . ^ $ * ? {} () \ | 
[] -> set of characters
. -> any single character except '\n'
^ -> checks if string starts with certain pattern or character
$ -> checks if strings ends with certain character
* -> used for counting occurrences of patterns
+, ? -> matches one or more occurrences towards the pattern left
{x,y}, [x-y] -> its used for matching number of characters where x is lower limit and y is upper limit
| -> it acts like a or operator
() ->grouping in pattern

This is a doctest...
>>> result = re.match(pattern=pattern, string=test_string)
>>> result.span()
(0, 5)
>>> result.string
