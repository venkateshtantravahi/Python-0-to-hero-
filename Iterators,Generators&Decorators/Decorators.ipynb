    "# What Is Decorator In Python?\n",
    "Decorator is one of the coolest features of python, as the name suggests decorator is kind of for decorating something, which exists previously. A decorator is used for manipulating (adding, removing, or modifying features) the pre-existing functions or their output. It takes a function as an input, makes some changes, and returns it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having a hard time understanding this, then let’s go to the analog world and see what we can relate this to. So, here’s an analogy, suppose you have some cold water (pre-existing function) and you don’t like that, instead of that you want some warm water. So, what you will do is that you will pass it to a water heater (decorator) which will take your water (pre-existing function), turn it into warm water (make some changes) and finally return you some warm water. And Voila! This is all a decorator does\n",
    "\n",
    "And this kind of behavior where a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at the time of compilation is also known as metaprogramming."

    "# Why Do We Need Decorator?\n",
    "Till the point, you might have understood that a decorator is something that takes a function as input, makes some changes, and returns it. But the question arises why we need it.  The reason is we don’t always have access to pre-existing function’s code or imagine if you have written thousands or ten thousands of lines of code will you be able to navigate to that function easily, no right!\n",
