Python has a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers.
To get the list of methods that are derived from random module all you need to do is open python

# seed()
"""
The seed is used to initialize the random number generator. It acts as a start for number generator
when we use it for first time.
If we don't use this initializer the default initializer would be clocks time seconds. 
Repeated usage of seed function results in the same generation .
SYNTAX : random.seed(a, version)
where a = is optional , the seed value to generate the random value 
version = an int specifying how to convert a to int , default is 2.

# sample
"""
This method used for generating sample items from a list or range of items, without changing 
original sequence

# getstate() and setstate()
"""
Python's default generator is a Mersenne Twister with a state space that is 19937 bits, 
much larger than what you think of as the seed.

You can think of it conceptually as three functions:

f(seed) -> state0
g(statei) -> statei+1
h(statei) -> outcomei
When you start with a seed value using random.seed(), 
it generates a full state value of 19937 bits one time using function f(). 
Each time you use the generator, it advances to the next 19937 bit state using g() 
and returns the output found by collapsing the updated state down a single integer using h().

Normally you don't actually see the internal state which is at the core of the generator. 
getstate() bypasses the collapsing function h(), 
and setstate() bypasses the seeding function f(), 
so that you can reproduce your sequence from any point without having to go 
all the way back to the beginning and reproduce the entire sequence to that point.
