<a href="https://github.com/venkateshtantravahi/Python-0-to-hero-/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">Python.zip</a>
- You can directly clone the repo using https or ssh or github cli through their prompts 
``` 
command: git clone https://github.com/venkateshtantravahi/Python-0-to-hero-.git
```

# To Work with Code 
### Setup of python 

- For windows gui's guided installation file will be available on following websites as python can be installed directly as a package or you can install with anaconda distribution

```
Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
```

- For Ubuntu distributions you need to install packages from the terminal as no guided gui will be available there

```
Python: sudo apt install python
Anaconda : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/
```

### Creating Environments
Once the installations is done you can create separate envs to work standalone with this repo, which means that's like a private space where you install packages specific 
to this repo which doesn't effect the global packages, you can create env's in wo different ways 
- Creating env using pipenv
  ```
  pip--install: pip install virtualenv
  create env : virtualenv <name>
  ```
- Activation and deactivation
 ```
 acivation(Wndows) : mypthon\Scripts\activate
 activation(Ubuntu) : Source mypython/bin/activate
 deactivation : deactivate
 ```
- Creating using conda
```
creation : conda create -n <env_name> <python_version>
activation : conda activate <env_name>
deactivation : conda deactivate
```

### Running scripts
- For windows open the shell at desired folder 
   - for python file 
      ```C:\devspace> hello.py```
      
- For Ubuntu open the terminal 
  - for python file \
    ```xyz-PC:-$ python filename.py```
    
 ### Packages Installation
 - For some modules to work with in the repo there might be usage of external modules which may lead to error when you directly run these files prior installation 
 - to install these modules you can directly refer to pip[python package installer] or conda repo based on the installer on your machine
- If python is installed as standalone package in ubuntu or windows installer then pip should already be part of it, if not first install pip using following command:

``` python get-pip.py```
- or upgrade the current version using 

``` python -m pip install --upgrade pip```
- If you have installed anaconda you would already been configured with conda base env so you can refer the below repo's as requirement

<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/" target="_blank">Pip Repo</a>
<a href="https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda" target = "_blank">Conda Repo</a>

The only thing you have to do is go to that repo and search for package you wana install and it will give you the reuired information about it.
