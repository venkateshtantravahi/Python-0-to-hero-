This is a beginner project for learning strings, variables , i/o and concatenations .Mad Libs Generator 
teaches to manipulate user-inputted data as the Mad Libs refer to a series of inputs that a user enters. 
The input from the user could be anything from an adjective, a pronoun, or even a verb. 
After all the inputs are entered the application takes all the data and arranges it to build a story template.

# Loop back to this point once code finishes 
loop = 1
while(loop < 10):
    # All the questions that the program asks the user
    noun =  input("Choose a noun: ")
    p_noun = input("Choose a plural noun: ")
    noun2 = input("Choose a noun again: ")
    place = input("Name a place: ")
    adjective = input("Choose an adjective (Describing word): ")
    noun3 = input("Choose a noun again: ")

    # Display the story based on the user input
    print("---------------------------------------------------")
    print("Be kind to your", noun, "- footed", p_noun)
    print("For a duck may be somebody's", noun2,",")
    print("Be kind to your ", p_noun,"in", place)
    print ("Where the weather is always",adjective,".")
    print ()
    print ("You may think that is this the",noun3,",")
    print ("Well it is.")
