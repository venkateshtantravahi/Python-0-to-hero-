    "# What Are Iterators?\r\n",
    "An Iterator is an object which can be iterated upon which means it can explore all values one by one. You can think of it as an object which holds more than one value and their value can be iterated (printed or used) one by one is called an iterator. For example lists, tuple, sets, dictionary, etc. are all examples of iterators.\r\n",
    "To create an iterator object you have to implement the two methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object. These methods are collectively called Iterator protocol.\r\n",

    "__iter__() method is called by iter() function, which returns the iterator object itself. This iterator object then can be used with for loop or in statements\r\n",

    "Iterators let us build and deal with lazy iterables, which means you can utilise an iterator for lazy evaluation. This allows you to access the next member of the iterator without recalculating all of the previous elements. Iterators can save us a significant amount of memory and CPU time.\r\n",
